This program contains a set of lists that are combined and analyzed. 
First, it combines the list of missions and the dates which they happened.
Then, it scans each list to see which of those missions were a success and totals them.
It then calculates the success percentage.
Finally, it prints out all the above data as well as a list of missions that occurred before the year 2000.
